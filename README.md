# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Using only JavaScript, jQuery, nodeJS, express, CSS, and HTML, we have ourselves a responsive, single page app. 
This app will update you on all of your favourite people's enlightening thoughts, as well as enable you to share your own. Designed to bring a sense of calm through our welcoming, fun, yet stable colors. 

Use at your own discretion. Any ill-mannered tweets will be met with a unicorn hammer to the face
